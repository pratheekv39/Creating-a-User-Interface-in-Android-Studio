This project focuses on developing a user interface (UI) for a food menu application using Jetpack Compose, a modern toolkit for building native Android UIs. The project demonstrates the implementation of various UI components such as menu items, dish details, and theme setup using Jetpack Compose's declarative approach.

In this assessment, I developed the Little Lemon food menu user interface. The project includes composable functions to display menu items, dish details, and manage user interactions. Below are key components of the solution:

- MenuDish Composable: This composable displays a menu dish item using a Card and a Divider. When clicked, it navigates to the dish's details.

- DishDetails Composable: This composable shows detailed information about a specific dish, using data from the DishRepository class.

- Setting up the Theme: The project customizes the app's theme with specific colors and typography values from LittleLemonColor and MaterialTheme.
